# Khalah's Quick config

Meant to be simple, and have the panda01 up and running on any machine fast (tested on ubuntu)

Might need to install neovim separately. [For ubuntu 14.04](https://gist.github.com/humorless/e79174c0f72355dc64ac7280ca2d2b58)

## Holberton students Install
run `./student-install` after this nvim should be installed, along with helpful plugins, and settings

## Install
Run `./install.sh` in order to install all dependencies

Be sure to change your .gitconfig to actually be your name and email!

## About this config
this config is meant for a user of neovim, git, and tmux, although tmux isn't set to work out of the box.

### neovim
Uses
[nerd tree](https://github.com/preservim/nerdtree) as an explorer in nvim

[CtrlP](https://github.com/kien/ctrlp.vim) for a fuzzy finder

[SuperTab](https://github.com/ervandew/supertab) for autocompletion

[Solarized](https://github.com/altercation/vim-colors-solarized) as a colorscheme
