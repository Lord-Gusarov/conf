# Khalah's Quick config

Meant to be simple, and have the panda01 up and running on any machine fast (tested on ubuntu)

Might need to install neovim separately. [For ubuntu 14.04](https://gist.github.com/humorless/e79174c0f72355dc64ac7280ca2d2b58)

Run `./install.sh` in order to install all dependencies
