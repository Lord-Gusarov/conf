# Khalah's Quick config

Meant to be simple, and have the panda01 up and running on any machine fast (tested on ubuntu)

Might need to install neovim separately. [For ubuntu 14.04](https://gist.github.com/humorless/e79174c0f72355dc64ac7280ca2d2b58)

## Holberton students Install
run `./student-install` after this nvim should be installed, along with helpful plugins, and settings

to open up the directory listing (NERDTREE) use `\n`

## Install
Run `./install.sh` in order to install all dependencies

Be sure to change your .gitconfig to actually be your name and email!

## About this config
this config is meant for a user of neovim, git. meant to be simple and easy.
